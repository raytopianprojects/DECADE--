# syntax

- variable declarations begin with the keyword DECADE
- - variables are statically typed
- - integer types are KEANE1 (8-byte int), KEANE2 (16-byte int), KEANE4 (32-byte int), KEANE8 (64-byte int). Replace N with U for unsigned
- - float types are DECA4 (32-bit float) and DECA8 (64-bit double)
- - structs are type RAVIS and their value is a function pointer
- - - accessing struct members uses keyword RAVIS
- function declarations begin with the keyword JAM
- random function should begin with !roll followed by d(any number of dice) example !roll d1 will roll a 1
- built in functions should begin with the ! symbol

# technical details

- arrays are of dynamic length and should be implemented using lists
- imports are handled the same way as in c - just copying the content of the files. Function prototypes are made automatically.
- interpreter/complier should check to see if the Decade Jam is over or not and if it is have it fail to compile/interpret


# Standard Library
- some sort of GUI library
- networking library
