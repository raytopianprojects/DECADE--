# syntax

- variable declarations begin with the keyword DECADE
- function declarations begin with the keyword JAM
- built in functions should begin with the ! symbol
- all statements are enclosed in `[]` similarly to lisp
- polish notation is used
- everything is done as a function call. Making a variable, getting a list field etc.

# technical details

- arrays are of dynamic length and should be implemented using lists
- imports are handled the same way as in c - just copying the content of the files. Function prototypes are made automatically.
- interpreter/complier should check to see if the Decade Jam is over or not and if it is have it fail to compile/interpret


# Standard Library
- random function should begin with !roll followed by d(any number of dice) example !roll d1 will roll a 1
- some sort of GUI library
- networking library
