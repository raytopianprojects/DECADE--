# syntax

- variable declarations begin with the keyword DECADE
- function declarations begin with the keyword JAM

# technical details

- arrays are of dynamic length and should be implemented using lists
- imports are handled the same way as in c - just copying the content of the files. Function prototypes are made automatically.
